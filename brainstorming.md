## New App Ideas - List
1. Recipe Book/Grocery Shopping
   - Allows users to create a list of recipes they want to cook for the week, and generates a shopping list with all the necessary items for them.
3. Calendar with news
    - Allows users to see and pin news stories in their own personalized calendar app. 
5. Game Search Up App
    - Will be an independent app that will allow the users to look up any game they would like. Compared to the Steam app it would show where you could buy it from the price and more!
7. Symptom Tracker
    - Allows users to record their symptoms, as well as search up possible causes. 
9. Event planner app
    - Allows users to create a personalized group and post about things they want to do that day. It could also randomly generate some ideas depending on what they want to do.
1. Library App
   - Can find any book you want and where they sell the book. As well as a virtual bookshelf to track which books you have read.

## Top 3 New App Ideas

3. Library App

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Recipe Book/Grocery Shopping
   - **Description:** Contains a database of recipes for users to choose from, as well as a form to add their own recipes. Users can save any of these recipes to their own "recipe box" or favorites section. They can view information about how to make any given recipe, as well as the required ingredients. The user can create a meal plan for the week (or any determined amount of time) by adding in recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc. throughout the week. The app will then create a grocery shopping list for them that encompasses all the recipes. 
   - **Category:** Food/Organizer
   - **Mobile:** This app is especially useful as a mobile app because when people are grocery shopping, they will have their phone on them to view their grocery list. This mobile ability is incredibly useful when going to a grocery store.
   - **Story:** This app will allow people to better plan their grocery trips and get everything they need for the week. It will be much easier to remember every single item they need for all the recipes they want to cook, and to not get items they don't need which would otherwise go bad.
   - **Market:** There is a very large audience for this app in the sense that anyone who cooks or grocery shops could make use of this app. 
   - **Habit:** This app would most likely be used by someone weekly for shopping lists, and daily for recipe instructions.
   - **Scope:** The most challenging parts of this app would be making a personalized database for users and saving that data. Even without every last feature, this app would still be interesting and valuable to users. The scope is clearly defined because the problem is fully understood, meaning the solution of the app is also much easier understood.
2. Game Search Up App
    - **Description**: Will have search up menu that will allow users to look up a specific game with a search box or a set of game types that they can choose from. If a user clicks on one of the games that are displayed it'll show them what platforms it is sold on like Steam or Itch.io as well as the price of them.
   - **Category:** Video Games
   - **Mobile:** What makes this app stand out from any other website that does this, is that it will allow the users to compare the prices of where they can buy the game. It will be easier to look up the price of these games from just your phone rather than visiting multiple websites to check the price of a game.
   - **Story:** Gamers would love this app as Steam is seen to be the general market of where you should look up and buy games. With this app they will be able to save some money by buying it from other video game distributers. 
   - **Market:** The market would mainly be towards people who play video games and the estimated amount of people who play is about 3.24 million. As well the video game industry is still relatively new so making new and improved apps will create traction relatively fast.
   - **Habit:** An average user would open this app after getting their paycheck as they would be able to afford a new game they have been looking at for a while. They can easily open the app and find which platform sells the game for the cheapest.
   - **Scope:** The search engine would be the most difficult part of this app as it would have to make multiple API calls to different video game distributers and compare then to find the best one. Another challenge is displaying another screen that will show the API information as we haven't learned it in class that well.
4. Library App
    - **Description**: Allows users to search for new books based on certain filters they can add to their search. Contains a personal bookshelf where users can add books they have read, are reading, and want to read.
   - **Category:** Reading
   - **Mobile:** Being able to look up books from one's phone is much easier than looking through library shelves. While users may still go to the library to pick up books they find in the app, the app will provide and easy way to find their next read through personalized searches. 
   - **Story:** Creates a digital space for users to document their reading and find new books that are perfect for them.
   - **Market:** Anyone who reads would find great use of this app. People who are constantly searching for their next read would find it useful to be able to find new books based on their previous likes.
   - **Habit:** This would not be an app that users check daily, or are incentivized to check often. It would merely be a space for them to visit whenever they wanted to read a new book, and didn't already have one picked out.
   - **Scope:** I believe that the hardest part while creating the app will be having the app remember the books that they liked when they closed the app initially. This could be an easy process but we haven't gone over it in class yet and could be confusing at first. However a stripped-down version would still be interesting and fun to build. 
## Final Decision
We chose to create the grocery app because it sounded fun, interesting, and useful to build. Given the time constraints of the project, this app would be a good choice because even without all the projected features implemented, it would still be interesting to create.
